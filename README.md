# CS210 Project Three

## This program allows the user to track the number of times an item occurs in a list or print a histogram of the results.  Program input can be any text file.

* This program demonstrates a strong integration of C++ and Python modules.  

* This code could be enhanced by wrapping the Python file open functions in a try/except statement.  Additionally, the input text file could be opened with a 'with open' statement so the file close is handled implicitely.  Another improvement would be better handling of exceptions.

* The piece of this project that I found most challenging to write was the CMakeLists.txt file.  It took a few attempts to configure this file properly so that the C++ main communicated with the Python interpreter as expected.

* The skills this project demonstrate are strong troubleshooting technique, understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of different programming languages, and how to properly parse through a file to extract particular information.

* The C++ file of this project was written with OOP principles in mind.  Because the main function is quite slim and functions are encapsulated, the program is easily modified and debugged for any future adaptations.
